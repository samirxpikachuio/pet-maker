# Comprehensive Plan to Address Hydration Mismatch Error

## Plan
1. **Identify Potential Causes**:
   - Review the use of any client-side only code (e.g., `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`) that may affect rendering.
   - Check for any usage of variables that change on each render, such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`.
   - Ensure that any date formatting is consistent between server and client.
   - Verify that the HTML structure is valid and that there are no issues with tag nesting.

2. **Review External Dependencies**:
   - Investigate if any browser extensions might be interfering with the HTML before React loads.

3. **Update Code**:
   - If any issues are found in the above checks, make necessary adjustments to the code to ensure consistency between server-rendered and client-rendered HTML.

4. **Testing**:
   - After making changes, test the application to ensure that the hydration error is resolved and that the application behaves as expected.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document any changes made and the reasoning behind them for future reference.

## Follow-Up Steps
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
